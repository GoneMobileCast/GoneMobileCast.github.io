          What's new in iOS7? In this episode, we talk to [Mike Bluestein](http://twitter.com/mikebluestein) from Xamarin to hear his thoughts on some of the new iOS7 API's such as UIKit Dynamics, Sprite Kit, Text Kit and more!  We also debate the merits of the new iPhone 5C, and discuss the other new hardware including Touch ID.
