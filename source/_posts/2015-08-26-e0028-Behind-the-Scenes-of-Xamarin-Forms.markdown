In this episode we're talking about Xamarin.Forms again, but this time around it's a bit different. We're joined once again by Jason Smith, lead developer of Xamarin.Forms, to take a look behind the scenes of Xamarin.Forms. We get into where it came from, inspirations, design decisions, triumps, mistakes, and more. Join us for this peek behind the curtain of creating the Xamarin.Forms framework!
